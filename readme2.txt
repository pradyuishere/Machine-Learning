Python version 3.6.5

problem 1: Takes in the inputs with an arbitary dimension of features and gives a binary prediction.

problem 2: Takes the input value for k, arbitarary input features and predicts the binary class. We can observe that low vales of k give a highly inconsistent solution. And high values of k give a very generalised solution.
